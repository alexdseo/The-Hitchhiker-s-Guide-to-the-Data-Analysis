# The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Data-Science

"Far out in the uncharted data of the unfashionable end of your database lies a small unregraded insight."

Douglas Adams' historic novel 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' starts with a sentence something like this but with different wordings.
I always thought a great novel starts with an outstanding opening sentence that brings out reader's emotions, curiosity and spirit.
I pharaphrased Douglas Adams' opening sentence from his book to start this repository about Data Science, not just because of the name of this repository but to make readers of this repository feel excited to learn about Data Science from A to Z.  

This repository is mainly for my own purpose but I really hope it could be helpful to anybody who randomly encounters this repository. I'm not an expert nor a proclaimed Data Scientist (well, at least not yet), so there definitely will be a lot of mistakes and better ways to do for certain things. Please do not hesitate to give me any feedbacks.

Have fun :)

## 0. Starting a Data Science project

What makes your project a 'Data Science' project? Why do you need to make your project a 'Data Science' project? How do you start a 'Data Science' project? For Any kind of project you start, your project would need a data. For example, let's say, you would like to start a project of making a new design for the car.

You would need a data of what kind of car models were successful in the past, a data of how people thought about the latest desings, a data of what kind of new features you could adapt to this new car design and so on. You could either collect these data or create a data you need for this project. Then, after collecting and creating these data, what are you going to do with this data? Data itself, either you collected and created, does not tell you anything. But then, you would be asking, what are all this fuss about the possibilitis of big data? Okay, I have all these data that I collected and created, what do I have to do next? I could analyze these data, say make a bar chart, and get some useful information. Does that make my project a 'Data Science' project? What makes my project a 'Data Science' project exactly, and if so, why? how? I will try to explain these questions in this repository.

So, what makes your project a 'Data Science' project? As I mentioned, data itself does not tell you anyting. Data itself, just shows what is there, in other words, facts. For example, let's say, you have a set of data about heights of mothers and daughters.
