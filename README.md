# The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Data-Science

"Far out in the uncharted data of the unfashionable end of your database lies a small unregraded insight."

Douglas Adam's historic novel 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' starts with a sentence something like this but with different wordings.
I always thought a great novel starts with an outstanding opening sentence that brings out reader's emotions, curiosity and spirit.
I pharaphrased Douglas Adams' opening sentence from his book to start this repository about Data Science, not just because of the name of this repository but to make readers of this repository feel excited to learn about Data Science from A to Z.  

This repository is mainly for my own purpose but I really hope it could be helpful to anybody who randomly encounter this repository. I'm not an expert or a proclaimed Data Scientist (well, at least not yet), so there definitely will be a lot of mistakes and better ways to do for certain things. Please do not hesitate to give me any feedbacks.

Have fun :)
