# The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Data-Science

"Far out in the uncharted data of the unfashionable end of your database lies a small unregraded insight."

Douglas Adams' historic novel 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' starts with a sentence something like this but with different wordings.
I always thought a great novel starts with an outstanding opening sentence that brings out reader's emotions, curiosity and spirit.
I paraphrased Douglas Adams' opening sentence from his book to start this repository about Data Science, not just because of the name of this repository but to make readers of this repository feel excited to learn about Data Science from A to Z.  

This repository is mainly for my own purpose but I really hope it could be helpful to anybody who randomly encounters this repository. I'm not an expert nor a proclaimed Data Scientist (well, at least not yet), so there definitely will be a lot of mistakes and better ways to do for certain things. Please do not hesitate to give me any feedbacks.

Have fun :)

## 0. Starting a Data Science project

What makes your project a 'Data Science' project? Why do you need to make your project a 'Data Science' project? How do you start a 'Data Science' project? For Any kind of project you start, your project would need a data. For example, let's say, you would like to start a project of making a new design for the car. 

![Image1_README](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35958537/95600857-54046880-0a18-11eb-83d7-44f13913638a.jpg)

You would need a data of what kind of car models were successful in the past, a data of how people thought about the latest desings, a data of what kind of new features you could adapt to this new design and so on. You could either collect these data or create a data you need for this project. Then, after collecting and creating these data, what are you going to do with this data? Data itself, either you collected or created, does not tell you anything. But then, you would be asking, what are all this fuss about the possibilities of big data? Okay, I have all these data that I collected and created, what do I have to do next? I could analyze these data, say make a bar chart, and get some useful information. Does that make my project a 'Data Science' project? What makes my project a 'Data Science' project exactly, and if so, why? how? I will try to explain these questions in this section.

So, what makes your project a 'Data Science' project? As I mentioned, data itself does not tell you anyting. Data itself, just shows what is there, in other word, facts. For example, let's say, you have a set of data about heights of mothers and daughters. 

![Image2_README](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35958537/95828883-2579dc80-0cfb-11eb-9be4-e6274b0e0988.png)

This set of data literally tells you nothing but the facts about heights of mothers and daughters. What do we need to do with this data to make it useful? That is where Data Science takes its part. Using this raw data you could make a visualization, code predictive models, set a hypothesis of your own theory or even conduct a experimental test and so on. Using these scientifical methods you could know more than just a fact about your dataset and tell something new about the data you have. However, you cannot bear fruit that easily. In other words, there are many steps you need to take before you get something new out of it and make your data science project successful. I could reference some detailed steps on how to make your project better but I will leave that section for later and rather tell you what can you get from a successful data science project. From a successful data sciene project, you can get full of information based on the data you have, and from that information you can learn new knowledge, and finally, from the knowledge you learned you can obtain wisdom. You could write more than 100 pages about what makes a project 'Data scince' project, but in my opinion to simply put, this process of acquiring wisdom from a simple raw data is what makes a data science project.

Okay, learning new knowledge and gaining wisdom from simple facts can be cool and all, but why should I make my project a 'Data Science' project? The moment you start a project or make a decision, you will come up with your own ideas. These ideas will be based on your experience, knowledge and your own perspective. However, since you are not a computer, you won't be free with your own biases. This does not mean that your ideas are wrong but you might miss on other opportunities. This is the reason why we collaborate with others from different discipline. However, this opportunity to collaborate with others is not always available and it could be costly. Therefore, to efficiently make objective and valid inferences based on your data, free from human biases, we need a help from data science. From this scientific process, you can make quicker and better decisions for right situation and for right people continuously. Moreover, using sophisticated statistical models, such as deep learning, you can bring out your data's full potential and make your imagination come true.

I hope these reasons have intrigued you enough to start your own data science project. So, how do you start a data science project? Follow through the notebook files I created for each chapters and find out!
